### 2. Resume

My goal is to become a sought-after developer. Comprehend the front end and master the backend. I want to create very cool and beautiful websites and games. I model well in my head, I play checkers and chess very well, and I like to consider non-standard options for solving problems. I always try to complete the matter and glorify everything on the fly.
